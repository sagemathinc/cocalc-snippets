title: Vector
descr: |
  Sage is able to build vectors of elements in a ring.
  When no ring is specified, it deduces it from the given elements.

  Look at the different parents of $v_1$ and $v_2$.
code: |
  v1 = vector([1,2,3])
  print(v1)
  print(v1.parent())
  v2 = vector([-1.1, 2.2, 3])
  print(v2)
  print(v2.parent())
---
title: Matrix
descr: |
  Sage is able to build matrices of elements in a ring.
  Similar to vectors, the ring is deduced from the elements.

  In this case here, we explicitly tell Sage that the ring is `RDF`, though.
code: |
  m1 = matrix([[1, 2], [4, -1]])
  print(m1)
  print(m1.parent())
  m2 = matrix(RDF, [[1, 2], [4, -1]])
  print(m2)
  print(m2.parent())
---
title: Accessing Elements
descr: |
  One fundamental task to master with vectors and matrices is to extract parts of it.
  Python, as the underlying programming language, and hence Sage start indexing at zero.
  For a matrix, the first entry in square brackets is the row, the second the column.

  Use the `:` sign to select a whole row or column.
code: |
  A = matrix([[ 1, 2, 3, 4],
             [ 5, 6, 7, 8],
             [ 9,10,11,12]])
  print(A[1, 3])  # 2nd row, 4th element: 8
  print(A[:, 1])  # 2nd column: [2, 6, 10] transposed
---
title: Basic Arithmetic
descr: |
  Here, we add, multiply and dot-product two rows or columns of the matrix $A$.
code: |
  A = matrix([[ 1, 2, 3, 4],
             [ 5, 6, 7, 8],
             [ 9,10,11,12]])
  # sum of second and third column
  print(A[:, 1] + A[:, 2])
  # dot-product of first and second row (note, we have to transpose it!)
  print(A[0, :] * A[1, :].transpose())
---
title: Elementwise Product
descr: If you actually mean to multiply elements and not the dot-product, use the method `elementwise_product`.
code: |
  A = matrix([[ 1, 2, 3, 4],
             [ 5, 6, 7, 8],
             [ 9,10,11,12]])
  A.elementwise_product(A)
---
title: Ranges of elements
descr: |
  You can use `start:end` to specify a range of elements to pick.
  The `end` index is not inclusive!
code: |
  A = matrix([[ 1, 2, 3, 4],
              [ 5, 6, 7, 8],
              [ 9,10,11,12]])
  # Look carefully at the output of the following to understand what part of the matrix got extracted.
  # Don't be why to play with the indices!
  A[0:2, 1:3]
---
title: Inverse of a Matrix
descr: |
  You can either all the method `.inverse()` or use the `~` operator.

  Note, that the inverse depends on the ring!
code: |
  m1 = matrix([[1, 2], [4, -1]])
  print(m1.inverse())
  m2 = matrix(RDF, [[1, 2], [4, -1]])
  print(~m2)
---
title: Kernel
code: |
  A = matrix(RDF, [[1, -2, 2],
                   [4, -1, 1],
                   [1, -1, 1]])
  kernel(A)
---
title: Solve a Linear System
descr: You can solve a linear system either left or right. The backslash `\` is a shortcut.
code: |
  A = matrix(RDF, [[1, -2, 9],
                   [4,  0, 2],
                   [1, -2, 1]])
  b = vector(RDF, [9, 5, -1])
  x = A.solve_right(b)
  print("x:         {}".format(x))
  print("check A*x: {}".format(A * x))
  print("bashslash: {}".format(A \ b))
---
title: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
descr: |
  This code iterates over the left eigenvalues/eigenvectors of a matrix B.
  The method returns a triple of eigenvalues, vectors and multiplicity.
code: |
  B = matrix([[1, 3, 2],
              [1, 3, 2],
              [1, 3, 6]])
  for ev, evec, mult in B.eigenvectors_left():
      print("Eigenvalue: {} with eigenvector: {} of multiplicity {}".format(ev, evec[0], mult))
---
title: Reduced row Echelon Form
descr: |
  Here, we create a matrix $C$ and compute the row reduced echelon form.

  Notice again, when we **change the ring** to $\mathbf{F}_2$ (all numbers are modulo 2) for matrix $C_2$,
  not only the matrix itself but also the result of this method changes.
test: |
  [ 1  0 -1]
  [ 0  1  2]
  [ 0  0  0]
  [1 0 1]
  [0 1 0]
  [1 0 1]
  [1 0 1]
  [0 1 0]
  [0 0 0]
code: |
  C = matrix([[3, 4, 5],
              [2, 3, 4],
              [1, 2, 3]])
  print(C.echelon_form())

  C2 = C.change_ring(GF(2))
  print(C2)
  print(C2.echelon_form())
